# Project Portfolio Iwan Bork

Hi everyone! I'm Iwan Bork, a passionate computer vision engineer!
I studied Cognitive Informatics for my bachelor's degree at Bielefeld University, Germany, where I studied the fundamentals of computer science, specializing in computer vision and image processing. This sparked my interest in this field, and I subsequently completed an Erasmus Mundus master's program in image processing and computer vision, where I studied in Budapest, Madrid, and Bordeaux.
Over the course of my life, I've completed various projects that I'd like to present on this site. Unfortunately, for data protection reasons, I'm not allowed to show pictures of some projects, as they were created at the respective companies, but I hope you enjoy exploring my projects anyway.
